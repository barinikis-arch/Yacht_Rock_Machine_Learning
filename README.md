This personal project was my first methodological practice in the use of various methods of data science, machine learning, and deep learning/neural networks. 

The theme of this project- to analyze Yacht rock/soft rock music using machine learning- was initially given its genesis by my friends, many of whom (including myself) are musicians with a love of soft rock and jazz-rock fusion. As such, in addition to the more serious aspects of the project, one will notice some less-professionally-oriented comments, such as the insistent use of continuously-differentiable activation functions purely because they are "smooth", in the spirit of the "smooth" music that defines Yacht rock.

For a more professional-oriented application of machine learning, please see my subsequent project applying ML methods to Alzheimer's disease transcriptomics data, found on my GitHub at www.github.com/barinikis-arch.



A similar project using this data set is occasionally used as piecemeal practice throughout online courses such as Kaggle's ML tutorials, but I wanted to build a maximally-involved project in that theme, assembling everything I had learned to take raw data all the way to a finished model, deploying tools from basic data cleaning and formatting all the way to pipelining and more advanced neural network design choices. In fact, the bulk of the time spent on the project was in data cleaning- auto-searching and matching the Yachtski scale scores to the Spotify database was quite difficult to automate, due to different naming schemes, live versions of songs, and other inconsistent formatting choices. This experience proved valuable in the Alzheimer's project, where the dataset was not given in a pandas-friendly format, requiring manual matching and cleaning.

Additionally, for this project I included basic conceptual overviews of what I had learned throughout my ML courses, meant for my friends and family to have a rough idea of what was going on (many are computer programmers), and also to solidify my own understanding. My familiarity with them has grown since then, but I have for the most part left the initial comments in.
