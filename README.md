This project was initially given its genesis by my friends, many of whom (including myself) are musicians with a love of soft rock and jazz-rock fusion. As such, in addition to the more serious aspects of the project, one will notice some less-professionally-oriented comments, such as the insistent use of continuously-differentiable activation functions purely because they are "smooth", in the spirit of the "smooth" music that defines Yacht rock.

For a more professional-oriented application of machine learning, please see my subsequent project applying ML methods to Alzheimer's disease transcriptomics data, found on my GitHub at www.github.com/barinikis-arch.



This personal project is my first methodological practice in the use of various methods of data science, machine learning, and deep learning/neural networks.

I decided that a good place to start was in something with easily-accessible data, and settled on predicting song ratings from music data available through Spotify. A similar project is given as piecemeal practice throughout online courses such as Kaggle's ML tutorials, but I wanted to build a maximally-involved project in that theme, assembling everything I had learned to take raw data all the way to a finished model, deploying tools from basic data cleaning and formatting all the way to pipelining and more advanced neural network design choices.

Additionally, I included basic conceptual overviews of what I had learned throughout my ML courses, meant for my friends and family to have a rough idea of what was going on (many are computer programmers), and also to solidify my own understanding. My familiarity with them has grown since then, but I have for the most part left the initial comments in.
